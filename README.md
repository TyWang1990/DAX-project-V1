# DAX Practical Techniques for Microsoft Power BI

## Project Summary

Welcome to the DAX Practical Techniques project! The goal of this project is to reinforce the understanding and proficiency in using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) within Microsoft Power BI to solve real-world business problems. 

DAX is a powerful formula language that enables advanced calculations, data modeling, and analysis in Power BI. This project focuses on enhancing the practical skills by exploring various categories of DAX functions and their application.

### Categories of DAX Functions

Throughout this project, I will dive into the following categories of DAX functions:

1. **Basic Aggregate Functions**: This category covers essential functions for calculating aggregations. The specific functions included in this project are **SUM** and **SUMX**.

2. **Filter Functions**: Learn how to manipulate and filter data using functions such as **ALL** and **FILTER**.

3. **Time Intelligence**: Gain proficiency in time-related calculations using functions like **TOTALMTD**, **TOTALQTD**, **DATEDIFF**, **MONTH**, **YEAR**, **CALENDARAUTO**, and **WEEKDAY**.

4. **Logical Functions**: Understand how to evaluate conditions and create logical statements using functions like **IF**, **NOT**, **AND**, and **SWITCH**.

5. **Relationship Functions**: Explore functions that establish relationships between tables, including **USERELATIONSHIP** and **CROSSFILTER**.

6. **Uncategorized Functions**: Discover miscellaneous functions that are commonly used in various scenarios, such as **CALCULATE**, **DATATABLE**, **SELECTEDVALUE**, **DIVIDE**, **DISTINCTCOUNT**, **TRUNC**, **FORMAT**, **CONCATENATE**, and **LEFT**.
